This is the folder where data should be stored.

You can write a custom adapter for this data in the
DataLoader class (in fact, that it a necessity).

There is no data here now because I do not have permission
to release a full data set yet. It is required that data be
in here (or anywhere on the development/deployment machine)
so it can be accessed from the DataLoader.
