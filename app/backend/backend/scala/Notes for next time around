Options are a really good idea

Don't use primitive types, it will cause nightmares when you come to aggregate the data
and need to average everything

Be careful with addition within a monad -- should 7 + NoInteger return 7 or NoInteger?

Aggregating is difficult -- average after summing

Don't use this pointless ResultListObject, just pass the LineListObject around
