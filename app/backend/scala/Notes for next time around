Options are a really good idea

Use double options almost everywhere

Be careful with addition within a monad -- should 7 + NoInteger return 7 or NoInteger?

Aggregating is difficult -- average after summing

Don't use this pointless ResultListObject, just pass the LineListObject around

Store date as month #, day #, year #, not as a java.util.date -- makes it impossible to
sort after an aggregate
