This is a scala/play project that is used to display data collected from garment factories.

Currently under heavy development. Eventual plans are to make this functional enough to run on a server as a production interfact to allow those factories that contributed to the project, and those who are considering contributing to view the data that they have/will helped to create

Current Status of production:

Most of the backend has now been completed, it should be capable of handling any queries thrown at it.
